    "# **object oriented programing**\n",
    "+ In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming. The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.\n",

    "To understand the need for creating a class let’s consider an example, let’s say you wanted to track the number of dogs that may have different attributes like breed, and age. If a list is used, the first element could be the dog’s breed while the second element could represent its age. Let’s suppose there are 100 different dogs, then how would you know which element is supposed to be which? What if you wanted to add other properties to these dogs? This lacks organization and it’s the exact need for classes. \n",

    "Access modifiers are keywords that define the accessibility of class members (variables and methods) in object-oriented programming. In Python, there are three access modifiers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Public: Public members are accessible from anywhere, both within the class and outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Protected: Protected members are accessible within the class and its subclasses. However, they are not intended to be accessed from outside the class or its subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Private: Private members are only accessible within the class itself. They cannot be accessed from outside the class, not even from its subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ In this code, the access modifiers are used to control the visibility and accessibility of the class attributes and methods. By using access modifiers, we can enforce encapsulation and data hiding, which are important principles in object-oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Note: In Python, access modifiers are not strictly enforced like in some other languages (e.g., Java). The convention is to use a single underscore (_) prefix for protected members and a double underscore (__) prefix for private members. However, it's important to note that these are just conventions and can still be accessed if needed.\n"
