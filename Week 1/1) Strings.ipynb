    "# **Strings**\n",
    "In Python, a string is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes. It can be either a single-quoted string ('...') or a double-quoted string (\"...\"). Strings are one of the most commonly used data types in Python to represent textual data. They are immutable, which means that once a string is created, it cannot be modified. However, you can create a new string based on an existing string by concatenating, slicing, or using string methods. Python also supports various operations on strings such as concatenation, slicing, finding the length of a string, and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above mention strings are immutable we cannot change once the string is created but we can create another string and use the existing variable to point to that address of the string\n",
    "\n",
    "storage of strings is as similar to the number in Python as they are created then they are pointed by the variable. The same goes with the string as well if the string is of small size then the address of two variables pointing a similar string will be the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "in python, there is no character data type it has only a string to identify a single character or more than those in java and c we can define a='a' the a goes to the character but in Python, we have the flexibility that this also counts as a string.\n",
