Closures are a powerful feature in many programming languages, including JavaScript and Python.\n","\n","### How Closures Work\n","\n","When a function is defined inside another function, the inner function has access to the variables and parameters of the outer function. This is because the inner function forms a closure around the outer function's scope.\n","\n","### Why Use Closures?\n","\n","Closures are useful for several reasons:\n","1. **Data Encapsulation**: Closures allow you to create private variables that can only be accessed and modified by the inner function.\n","2. **Function Factories**: You can use closures to create functions with preset parameters.\n","3. **Maintaining State**: Closures can maintain state between function calls.\n","\n","### Example of a Closure\n","\n","Here's an example in Python to illustrate how closures work:\n","\n","```python\n","def outer_function(msg):\n","    # This is the outer enclosing function\n","    message = msg\n","\n","    def inner_function():\n","        # This is the nested function\n","        print(message)\n","\n","    return inner_function\n","\n","# Create a closure\n","closure = outer_function(\"Hello, World!\")\n","# Call the closure\n","closure()\n","```\n","\n","In closure we are returning the inner function and we are calling the inner function outside the outer function and it is still able to access the message variable of the outer function\n","\n","### Example of a Closure with Parameters\n","```python\n","def outer_function(msg):\n","    def inner_function(name):\n","        print(f\"{msg}, {name}!\")\n","\n","    return inner_function\n","```\n","\n","Here we can also pass the parameters to the inner function and it will work as expected and also call the inbuilt function with the parameters\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"18837642","metadata":{"id":"18837642","outputId":"8acb99f1-7917-4a0e-e850-18c0142128d3"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Hello, World!\n"]}],"source":["def outer_function(msg):\n","    # This is the outer enclosing function\n","    message = msg\n","\n","    def inner_function():\n","        # This is the nested function\n","        print(message)\n","\n","    return inner_function\n","\n","# Create a closure\n","closure = outer_function(\"Hello, World!\")\n","# Call the closure\n","closure()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"id":"68eb7633","metadata":{"id":"68eb7633","executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1755436556880,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":32,"user":{"displayName":"Smruti Kankrecha","userId":"18429169694842532570"}},"outputId":"861f7a24-24bf-42a8-e4ec-7436f6a70289","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":211}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"error","ename":"TypeError","evalue":"outer_function() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given","traceback":["\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mTypeError\u001b[0m                                 Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[0;32m/tmp/ipython-input-993177244.py\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m<cell line: 0>\u001b[0;34m()\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      6\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      7\u001b[0m \u001b[0;31m# Create a closure\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m----> 8\u001b[0;31m \u001b[0mclosure\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m \u001b[0mouter_function\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\"Hello, World!\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\"ansh\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m      9\u001b[0m \u001b[0;31m# Call the closure\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m     10\u001b[0m \u001b[0mclosure\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[0;31mTypeError\u001b[0m: outer_function() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given"]}],"source":["def outer_function(msg):\n","    def inner_function(name):\n","        print(f\"{msg}, {name}!\")\n","\n","    return inner_function\n","\n","# Create a closure\n","closure = outer_function(\"Hello, World!\",\"ansh\")\n","# Call the closure\n","closure()"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.13.2"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
