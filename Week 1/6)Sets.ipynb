    "+ This is an unordered collection of the data in any\n",
    "+ Mathematically a set is a collection of items (not in any particular order). A Python set is similar to this mathematical definition with below additional conditions.\n",
    "+ The elements in a set cannot be repeated i.e. an element can occur only once.\n",
    "+ The elements in the set are immutable(cannot be modified) but the set as a whole is mutable.\n",
    "+ There is no index attached to any element in a Python set. So they do not support any indexing or slicing operation.\n",
    "+ The sets in python are typically used for mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and complement, etc.\n"
