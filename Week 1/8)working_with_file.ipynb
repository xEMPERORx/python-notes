    "# Working with Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with files in Python is a common task that involves reading from and writing to files. Here are some key points to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Opening a File\n",
    "\n",
    "To open a file, use the `open()` function. This function takes two arguments: the file name and the mode in which the file is opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'r')  # Open a file for reading\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Common modes include:\n",
    "- `'r'`: Read (default mode)\n",
    "- `'w'`: Write (creates a new file or truncates an existing file)\n",
    "- `'a'`: Append (adds to the end of the file)\n",
    "- `'b'`: Binary mode (used with other modes, e.g., `'rb'` for reading a binary file)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading from a File\n",
    "\n",
    "To read the contents of a file, you can use methods like `read()`, `readline()`, or `readlines()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "content = file.read()  # Read the entire file\n",
    "line = file.readline()  # Read a single line\n",
    "lines = file.readlines()  # Read all lines into a list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Writing to a File\n",
    "\n",
    "To write to a file, use the `write()` or `writelines()` methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'w')\n",
    "file.write('Hello, world!\\n')  # Write a string to the file\n",
    "file.writelines(['Line 1\\n', 'Line 2\\n'])  # Write a list of strings to the file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Closing a File\n",
    "\n",
    "Always close a file after you are done with it to free up system resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using `with` Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `with` statement is a good practice as it ensures the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is cleaner and more concise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a complete example of reading from and writing to a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Writing to a file\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:\n",
    "    file.write('Hello, world!\\n')\n",
    "    file.write('This is a test file.\\n')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reading from a file\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Using `file.seek()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `file.seek()` function is used to change the file's current position. This is useful when you need to move the cursor to a specific location in the file for reading or writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file.seek(offset, whence)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `offset`: The number of bytes to move the cursor.\n",
    "- `whence`: Optional argument that specifies the reference point for `offset`. It can be:\n",
    "    - `0`: Beginning of the file (default).\n",
    "    - `1`: Current file position.\n",
    "    - `2`: End of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'r+') as file:\n",
    "        file.write('Hello, world!\\n')\n",
    "        file.seek(0)  # Move the cursor to the beginning of the file\n",
    "        content = file.read()\n",
    "        print(content)\n",
    "```"

    "## Additional File Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the common file modes, there are a few more modes that can be useful in specific scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'x'`: Exclusive creation mode. This mode creates a new file and opens it for writing. If the file already exists, the operation fails.\n",
    "- `'r+'`: Read and write mode. This mode opens the file for both reading and writing.\n",
    "- `'w+'`: Write and read mode. This mode opens the file for both writing and reading. It creates a new file or truncates an existing file.\n",
    "- `'a+'`: Append and read mode. This mode opens the file for both appending and reading. It creates a new file if it does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exclusive Creation Mode (`'x'`)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    file = open('newfile.txt', 'x')\n",
    "    file.write('This file is created using exclusive creation mode.\\n')\n",
    "except FileExistsError:\n",
    "    print('File already exists.')\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Read and Write Mode (`'r+'`)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'r+') as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    file.write('\\nAdding a new line to the file.')\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Write and Read Mode (`'w+'`)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'w+') as file:\n",
    "    file.write('This will overwrite the file.\\n')\n",
    "    file.seek(0)\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Append and Read Mode (`'a+'`)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'a+') as file:\n",
    "    file.write('Appending a new line.\\n')\n",
    "    file.seek(0)\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Working with Binary Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary files are used to store data in a binary format. To work with binary files, you can use the following modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'rb'`: Read binary mode. This mode opens the file for reading in binary format.\n",
    "- `'wb'`: Write binary mode. This mode opens the file for writing in binary format. It creates a new file or truncates an existing file.\n",
    "- `'ab'`: Append binary mode. This mode opens the file for appending in binary format. It creates a new file if it does not exist.\n",
    "- `'rb+'`: Read and write binary mode. This mode opens the file for both reading and writing in binary format.\n",
    "- `'wb+'`: Write and read binary mode. This mode opens the file for both writing and reading in binary format. It creates a new file or truncates an existing file.\n",
    "- `'ab+'`: Append and read binary mode. This mode opens the file for both appending and reading in binary format. It creates a new file if it does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Read Binary Mode (`'rb'`)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('example.bin', 'wb') as file:\n",
    "    file.write(b'This is binary data.\\n')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Append Binary Mode (`'ab'`)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('example.bin', 'ab') as file:\n",
    "    file.write(b'Appending binary data.\\n')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Read and Write Binary Mode (`'rb+'`)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('example.bin', 'rb+') as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    file.write(b'\\nAdding binary data.')\n",
