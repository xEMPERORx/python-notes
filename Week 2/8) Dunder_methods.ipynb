    "# Dunder Methods in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Dunder methods, also known as magic methods or special methods, are predefined methods in Python that have double underscores (__) at the beginning and end of their names. These methods allow you to define the behavior of your objects for built-in operations such as arithmetic operations, comparisons, and type conversions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of Dunder Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Customization**: They allow you to customize the behavior of your objects for various operations.\n",
    "2. **Readability**: They make your code more readable and expressive.\n",
    "3. **Integration**: They enable your objects to integrate seamlessly with Python's built-in functions and operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Dunder Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization and Representation**\n",
    "    - `__init__(self, ...)`: Constructor method, called when an instance is created.\n",
    "    - `__repr__(self)`: Returns a string representation of the object, used by `repr()`.\n",
    "    - `__str__(self)`: Returns a string representation of the object, used by `str()` and `print()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Arithmetic Operations**\n",
    "    - `__add__(self, other)`: Defines behavior for the `+` operator.\n",
    "    - `__sub__(self, other)`: Defines behavior for the `-` operator.\n",
    "    - `__mul__(self, other)`: Defines behavior for the `*` operator.\n",
    "    - `__truediv__(self, other)`: Defines behavior for the `/` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Comparison Operations**\n",
    "    - `__eq__(self, other)`: Defines behavior for the `==` operator.\n",
    "    - `__ne__(self, other)`: Defines behavior for the `!=` operator.\n",
    "    - `__lt__(self, other)`: Defines behavior for the `<` operator.\n",
    "    - `__le__(self, other)`: Defines behavior for the `<=` operator.\n",
    "    - `__gt__(self, other)`: Defines behavior for the `>` operator.\n",
    "    - `__ge__(self, other)`: Defines behavior for the `>=` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Container Methods**\n",
    "    - `__len__(self)`: Defines behavior for the `len()` function.\n",
    "    - `__getitem__(self, key)`: Defines behavior for indexing, e.g., `obj[key]`.\n",
    "    - `__setitem__(self, key, value)`: Defines behavior for item assignment, e.g., `obj[key] = value`.\n",
    "    - `__delitem__(self, key)`: Defines behavior for item deletion, e.g., `del obj[key]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Context Management**\n",
    "    - `__enter__(self)`: Defines behavior for entering a context, used by `with` statements.\n",
    "    - `__exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback)`: Defines behavior for exiting a context, used by `with` statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Callable Objects**\n",
    "    - `__call__(self, ...)`: Makes an instance callable like a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Attribute Access**\n",
    "    - `__getattr__(self, name)`: Defines behavior for accessing an attribute that doesn't exist.\n",
    "    - `__setattr__(self, name, value)`: Defines behavior for setting an attribute.\n",
    "    - `__delattr__(self, name)`: Defines behavior for deleting an attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing these dunder methods, you can make your custom classes behave like built-in types and integrate more naturally with Python's syntax and features."
