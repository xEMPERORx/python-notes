    "## **Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where a class (child or derived class) inherits properties and methods from another class (parent or base class). Python supports inheritance and it's a powerful tool for code reusability and organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ By using inheritance, a child class can inherit attributes and behaviors from its parent class. This allows us to create specialized classes that inherit common functionality from a base class, reducing code duplication and promoting code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ To define a child class that inherits from a parent class, we use the syntax `class ChildClass(ParentClass):`. The child class can then access and use the attributes and methods of the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Python also supports multiple inheritance, where a class can inherit from multiple base classes. This is done by specifying multiple base classes in the class definition, separated by commas. `class multiple(Parent1 , parent2):`\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Inheritance allows us to create a hierarchy of classes, with each level inheriting and extending the functionality of the previous level. This promotes code organization, modularity, and flexibility in designing complex systems.\n"

    "## **Polymorphism**\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Polymorphism is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It is the ability of different objects to respond to the same method call in a way that is specific to their class.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Polymorphism promotes flexibility and integration in code, allowing for the implementation of methods that can work with objects of different types. This is achieved through method overriding and method overloading.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Method Overriding**: This occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. The method in the subclass has the same name, return type, and parameters as the method in the superclass. This allows the subclass to provide a specific behavior while still maintaining the same interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Method Overloading**: This is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method with the same name, but with different parameters. Python does not support method overloading directly, but it can be achieved using default arguments or variable-length arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Polymorphism allows for the design of more generic and reusable code. It enables the implementation of functions and methods that can operate on objects of different classes, as long as they share a common interface.\n",
