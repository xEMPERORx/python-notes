    "## **Exception Handling**\n",
    "+ Exception handling is a mechanism in programming that allows you to handle and manage errors or exceptional situations that may occur during the execution of your code. When an error or exception occurs, it disrupts the normal flow of the program and can cause the program to terminate abruptly.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Exception handling provides a way to gracefully handle these errors by catching and handling them in a controlled manner. Instead of the program crashing, you can write code to handle the error, take appropriate actions, and continue the execution of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ In most programming languages, including Python, exception handling is done using try-except blocks. The code that may potentially raise an exception is placed inside the try block, and the code to handle the exception is written inside the except block.\n"

    "### **Handling Exceptions in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, exceptions can be handled in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Using `try-except` block**: This is the most common way to handle exceptions. You place the code that might raise an exception inside a `try` block, and then you handle the exception in the `except` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using `try-except-else` block**: This structure allows you to add an `else` block, which will execute if no exceptions are raised in the `try` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Using `try-except-finally` block**: This structure includes a `finally` block, which will execute regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. It is typically used for cleanup actions.\n",
