    "## **Enumerate Function**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `enumerate()` function in Python is a built-in function that allows you to iterate over a sequence while also keeping track of the index of each item. It returns an enumerate object, which can be converted into a list of tuples or used directly in a loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to use the enumerate() function:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "    fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']\n",
    "\n",
    "    for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):\n",
    "        print(index, fruit)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Output\n",
    "```Output\n",
    "    0 apple\n",
    "    1 banana\n",
    "    2 orange \n",
    "```\n",
    "In the above code, the `enumerate()` function is used to iterate over the fruits list. It returns a tuple containing the index and the corresponding item from the list. The for loop then unpacks the tuple into the variables index and fruit, allowing you to access both the index and the item in each iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "The enumerate() function is often preferred over a regular for loop when you need to keep track of the index while iterating. It eliminates the need to manually create and increment a separate index variable. This can make your code more concise and readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Additionally, the enumerate() function is more efficient than manually incrementing an index variable because it is implemented as a C function, which makes it faster.\n",

    "## **Decorators**\n",
    "\n",
    "Decorators in Python are a powerful and flexible way to modify the behavior of functions or classes. They allow you to wrap another function in order to extend the behavior of the wrapped function, without permanently modifying it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax of a Decorator\n",
    "\n",
    "A decorator is a function that takes another function as an argument, adds some kind of functionality, and returns another function. This is helpful to \"wrap\" functionality with the same code over and over again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example of a decorator:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_decorator(func):\n",
    "    def wrapper():\n",
    "        print(\"Something is happening before the function is called.\")\n",
    "        func()\n",
    "        print(\"Something is happening after the function is called.\")\n",
    "    return wrapper\n",
    "\n",
    "@my_decorator\n",
    "def say_hello():\n",
    "    print(\"Hello!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "say_hello()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, `my_decorator` is a decorator function that takes another function `func` as an argument. Inside `my_decorator`, there is a nested function `wrapper` that adds some functionality before and after calling `func`. The `my_decorator` function returns the `wrapper` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `@my_decorator` syntax is a shorthand for applying the decorator to the `say_hello` function. It is equivalent to writing `say_hello = my_decorator(say_hello)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When `say_hello()` is called, it actually calls the `wrapper` function, which in turn calls the original `say_hello` function and adds the additional behavior before and after it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Using Decorators\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Code Reusability**: Decorators allow you to define reusable functionality that can be applied to multiple functions or methods.\n",
    "2. **Separation of Concerns**: They help in separating the core logic of a function from the additional functionality, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.\n",
    "3. **Enhanced Readability**: Using decorators can make the code more readable by clearly indicating that a function is being modified or extended in some way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Logging**: Adding logging functionality to functions.\n",
    "- **Access Control**: Implementing access control mechanisms, such as authentication and authorization.\n",
    "- **Memoization**: Caching the results of expensive function calls to improve performance.\n",
    "- **Timing**: Measuring the execution time of functions for performance analysis.\n",
